# UnitTesting - User Registration Example

This repository was created to demonstrate the difficulties of testing "mammoth" systems versus testing systems that are built using services or components.

You will find the differences as between the "Mammoth" folders and "ServiceBased" folders.

This repository uses Don't Panic Labs Service Helpers as a service locator, and Moq for mocking dependencies during testing.
